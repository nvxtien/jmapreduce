  var input = "A MapReduce program is composed of a Map() procedure (method) that\n" +
          " performs filtering and sorting\n" +
          "(such as sorting students by first name into queues,\n" +
          " one queue for each name) and a Reduce() method that \n" +
          "performs a summary operation (such as counting the number\n" +
          " of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies).\n\n" +
          " The 'MapReduce System' (also called 'infrastructure' or 'framework')\n" +
          " orchestrates the processing by marshalling\n\n\n" +
          " the distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel,\n" +
          " managing all communications and data transfers\n" +
          " between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy\n" +
          " and fault tolerance.\n" +
          " The model is inspired by the map and reduce functions commonly\n" +
          " used in functional programming, although their \n" +
          "purpose in the MapReduce framework is not the same as in their\n" +
          " original forms. The key contributions of \n" +
          "the MapReduce framework are not the actual map and reduce functions,\n" +
          " but the scalability and fault-tolerance\n" +
          " achieved for a variety of applications by optimizing\n" +
          " the execution engine once. As such, a single-threaded\n" +
          " implementation of MapReduce will usually not be faster than\n" +
          " a traditional (non-MapReduce) implementation,\n" +
          " any gains are usually only seen with multi-threaded implementations.\n" +
          " The use of this model is beneficial\n" +
          " only when the optimized distributed shuffle operation (which reduces\n" +
          " network communication cost) and fault tolerance\n" +
          " features of the MapReduce framework come into play. Optimizing the communication\n" +
          " cost is essential to a good MapReduce algorithm.";
